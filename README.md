# Categorical Naive Bayes on Adult Income Dataset

Implementation of a **Naive Bayes classifier from scratch** for categorical features, compared against **scikit-learn's MultinomialNB** on the [Adult Income dataset]

## Features
- Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, train/val/test split)  
- Custom Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing (α tuning)  
- Feature subset evaluation (all, demographics, work-related, minimal)  
- Probability confidence and class distribution analysis  
- Performance comparison with scikit-learn’s MultinomialNB  
- Visualizations: accuracy curves, probability distributions, bar charts
